## **Project - Covid-19 daily cases prediction using SVR model**
### Inroduction 
> Given a dataset containing temp, humid, dew and past daily cases to predict the future Covid-19 cases. 
> Using SVR model to predict 
> Evaluation: MSE

#### Part 1
Using Pre-set parameters to training the model. 
Need to format feature matrix.

#### Part 2
Tuning the parameters and get minimum MSE

##### **Key ideas**
* Feature matrix
* Model tuning

> To run the code:
> Open project spec notebook to run the code

> actual codes reside in submission.py

Report contains my ideas to solve the project.
